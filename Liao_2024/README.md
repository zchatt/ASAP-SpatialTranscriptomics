## ASAP-SpatialTranscriptomics

This repository contains analysis scripts used by The University of Sydney collaborators to analyse spatial transcriptomics as part of [Aligning Science Accross Parkinson's](https://parkinsonsroadmap.org/#).

NOTE: The "Liao_2024" directory contains scripts used in the analysis of "CHCHD2 mutant mice display mitochondrial protein accumulation and disrupted energy metabolism"

## Scripts

1. [validate_DEG.R](/Liao_2024/R/validate_DEG.R) - Scripts used for human validation (GeoMx) of DEGs identified by Visium assessment of CHCHD2 T61I point mutant mice.

2. [geneinterest_gx.R](/Liao_2024/R/geneinterest_gx.R) - Scripts used to analyse genes or gene sets of interest within human ST datasets (GeoMx)
